# NDS v3 — Nominal Device Support

NDS (Nominal Device Support) is a C++ library for writing device support for a
variety of control systems (CS) while hiding the details of the chosen control
system, so that driver authors can focus on device functionality.

A driver written against NDS is a plugin: it is compiled once against `libnds3`
and then loaded at runtime next to a control-system plugin (EPICS, PVXS, Tango,
…), without the driver source having to know which one it is talking to.

This repository contains **nds-core**, the control-system-agnostic core
library, hosted in the [NDSv3](https://github.com/NDSv3) GitHub organization as
[NDSv3/nds-core](https://github.com/NDSv3/nds-core).

Control-system bindings and device drivers live in separate repositories in the
same organization:

| Repository | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| [nds-core](https://github.com/NDSv3/nds-core) | This library — the NDSv3 core |
| [nds3-epics](https://github.com/NDSv3/nds3-epics) | EPICS control-system support |
| [nds-adq](https://github.com/NDSv3/nds-adq) | Driver for Teledyne ADQ digitizers |
| [nds3-core](https://github.com/NDSv3/nds3-core) | Clone of the original Cosylab NDS3, kept for history |

Further bindings and drivers (`nds-pvxs`, `nds-sdn`, `nds-irio`, `nds-nidaqx`,
`nds-nisync`, …) are maintained separately and not yet published in the
organization.

## Features

- Organizes a device into a tree-like structure of devices, channels,
  attributes (PVs), state machines, etc.
- Supports both data pull mode (passive scanning on EPICS, polling on Tango)
  and push mode (interrupt on EPICS, push on Tango).
- Driver code uses standard C++ types and Unix EPOCH timing to communicate with
  the library.
- On EPICS there is no need to supply separate `.db` files (though you still
  can if you want).
- Supplies a hierarchical state machine.
- Supplies specialized nodes for data acquisition, waveform generation,
  triggering and clocking, timing, routing, digital I/O, firmware handling,
  health monitoring and data multiplexing.
- Guaranteed binary compatibility between minor versions, so existing
  installations can be upgraded without recompiling the device support.

## Requirements

- **CMake** 3.10 or newer
- A **C++11** compiler (GCC 4.9+ is recommended because of
  [GCC bug 57869](https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=57869); MSVC on
  Windows — CI builds with the toolchain on GitHub's `windows-latest` image)
- A **threads** implementation (`find_package(Threads REQUIRED)`)
- **GoogleTest** — optional. If it is not installed, the build downloads
  GoogleTest v1.14.0 via CMake `FetchContent`, which requires network access at
  configure time. Only needed when `BUILD_TESTING=ON`.

On Windows two POSIX compatibility libraries are needed as well; see
[Building on Windows](#building-on-windows).

## Building on Linux

```bash
cmake -B build -S . -DBUILD_TESTING=ON -DBUILD_EXAMPLES=ON
cmake --build build -j$(nproc)
```

To produce an optimized build, pass a build type (this is a single-config
generator, so the build type is chosen at configure time):

```bash
cmake -B build -S . -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build -j$(nproc)
```

If GoogleTest is not installed and the machine has no network access,
configure with `-DBUILD_TESTING=OFF`.

### Installing

```bash
cmake --install build --prefix /usr/local
```

This installs:

- `lib/libnds3.so` — shared library
- `lib/libnds3.a` — static library
- `include/nds3/` — public headers

> **Note:** the build does not yet export a CMake package configuration, so
> `find_package(nds3)` is not available. Link against the library directly with
> `-lnds3` and add the install prefix to your include and library search paths.

## Building on Windows

NDS uses POSIX threads and `dlopen`-style dynamic loading, so two compatibility
libraries are required. The simplest route is [vcpkg](https://vcpkg.io):

```powershell
vcpkg install dlfcn-win32:x64-windows pthreads:x64-windows
```

Then configure and build with the vcpkg toolchain file:

```powershell
cmake -B build -S . -DBUILD_TESTING=ON -DBUILD_EXAMPLES=ON `
      -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE="$env:VCPKG_INSTALLATION_ROOT/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake" `
      -A x64
cmake --build build --config Release
```

Notes specific to Windows:

- Visual Studio is a *multi-config* generator, so the configuration is selected
  at build time with `--config`, not at configure time with
  `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`. The same applies to `ctest -C Release` and
  `cmake --install build --config Release`.
- `src/CMakeLists.txt` locates the two dependencies via `find_path`/
  `find_library`, searching for `pthread.h` plus `pthreadVC2`/`pthreadVC3`/
  `pthread`, and for `dlfcn.h` plus `dl`/`dlfcn`. If you install them outside
  vcpkg, point CMake at them with `-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=...`.
- The DLLs for `pthreads` and `dlfcn-win32` must be on `PATH` (or beside the
  executable) at runtime, including when running the tests.

## Build options

| Option | Default | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `BUILD_TESTING` | `ON` | Build `tests/` and register the CTest targets |
| `BUILD_EXAMPLES` | `ON` | Build the drivers under `examples/` |

Both are standard CMake cache variables, e.g. `-DBUILD_EXAMPLES=OFF`.

Two library targets are always produced: `nds3` (shared) and `nds3_static`
(static, installed as `libnds3.a`).

## Running the tests

Tests are registered with CTest and require `BUILD_TESTING=ON` (the default):

```bash
cd build
ctest --output-on-failure
```

On Windows add the configuration: `ctest --output-on-failure -C Release`.

Two CTest targets are registered:

| Target | Source | Cases |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `nds3-unit-tests` | `tests/unit/` | 129 GoogleTest cases across 22 suites |
| `nds3-unit-example` | `tests/unit-example/` | Tests for the `nds-example` driver |

> **The full suite takes roughly 12–13 minutes**, almost all of it in
> `nds3-unit-tests`, which exercises timing- and thread-sensitive behaviour.
> Do not wrap the run in a short timeout. `ctest -j` does not help much, since
> CTest only sees two targets.

For a faster edit/test loop, run the GoogleTest binaries directly and filter:

```bash
./build/tests/unit/nds3-unit-tests --gtest_list_tests
./build/tests/unit/nds3-unit-tests --gtest_filter='testPVs.*'
./build/tests/unit/nds3-unit-tests --gtest_filter='testStateMachine.*:testThreads.*'
```

`tests/unit/test.py` is a soak-test driver that re-runs each test 200–2000
times to flush out intermittent failures, recording any failure in an
`ErrorFile` next to the script.

## Using NDS in a driver

A driver is a shared library that links against `nds3` and registers itself
with the `NDS_DEFINE_DRIVER` macro:

```cpp
#include <nds3/nds.h>

class MyDevice
{
public:
    MyDevice(nds::Factory& factory,
             const std::string& deviceName,
             const nds::namedParameters_t& parameters);
    // ...
};

NDS_DEFINE_DRIVER(MyDevice, MyDevice)
```

`examples/nds-example/nds-example.cpp` is a complete worked example covering
PVs, a state machine, data acquisition and initializer callbacks.

### Plugin discovery at runtime

At startup NDS scans for control-system and device plugins in, in order:

1. the current directory (`.`)
2. `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`
3. `NDS_CONTROL_SYSTEMS` (control systems) and `NDS_DEVICES` /
   `NDS_PLUGIN_PATH` (devices)

Entries in these variables may be separated by `:`, `;` or spaces, and may be
quoted.

Plugins are recognized by filename: device plugins must be named
`lib<something>NdsDevice.so`, control-system plugins `lib<something>NdsControlSystem.so`
or `lib<something>NdsControlSystem`.

> **Note:** the `.so` filename pattern is matched on every platform, Windows
> included — the dynamic loading itself goes through `dlfcn-win32` there.

Naming rules for the generated PV names are configurable; see
`examples/naming_rules.txt` for a documented example of the ini-file format.

## Documentation

The NDSv3 project is hosted at <https://github.com/NDSv3>; this library is
[NDSv3/nds-core](https://github.com/NDSv3/nds-core).

There is no published API reference site for the project yet. The legacy
reference at <https://cosylab.github.io/nds3/> describes the original Cosylab
NDS3 and predates this repository, so build the reference locally instead —
Doxygen generates XML which Sphinx renders via Breathe:

```bash
pip install sphinx breathe sphinx-rtd-theme

mkdir -p doc/_build/doxygen
doxygen doc/Doxyfile

mkdir -p doc/_build/html
sphinx-build -b html doc/sphinx doc/_build/html
```

The result is at `doc/_build/html/index.html`.

## Continuous integration

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` builds and tests on Linux and Windows and builds the
documentation on every push and on pull requests against `master`/`main`. The
build commands in this README mirror what CI runs.
